      highlights:
        - Budu is a Malaysian favourite fish sauce, which is produced by fermenting in over 6 months.
        - Some samples were dominated by <i>Tetragenococcus</i>, but was almost absent in other samples.
        - Amino acid metabolism and purine metabolism were of interest. The predicted metabolism of a Budu sample coincides with the abundance and species diversity.
